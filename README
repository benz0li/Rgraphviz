Installing Rgraphviz:

The Rgraphviz package requires a bit of extra work beyond 
simply installing the package itself to run properly.  The user
must first have installed the GraphViz software provided by AT&T
(which must be at least version 1.9.20030401.0515).  To do this:

- Go to http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/
- Download GraphViz (it is recommended to take 'graphviz-current',
  which will be the latest version).  NOTE: Please download the source
  and build using the sources instead of using RPMs or other prepackaged
  methods.  For instance, to use graphviz-current, get graphviz-current.tar.gz.
- Unpack the distribution
- In the GraphViz directory, run './configure', 'make' and finally
  'make install'.  If you have special configuration needs, specify
  them with the './configure'.

Finally, make sure that you have the 'graph' R package installed.  

Once these things are both installed properly, you can then proceed
to install Rgraphviz.
