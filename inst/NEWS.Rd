\section{Version 2.1.x}{
  \itemize{
    \item Rgraphviz now requires Graphviz >= 2.16.
    \item Added graphvizCapabilities() that reports the capabilities of
    Graphviz.  This requires Graphviz >= 2.28 and returns NULL if the
    Rgraphviz installation does not support it.
    \item Rgraphviz now comes bundled with Graphviz 2.28, greatly
    simplifying installation.
    \item Numerous bugfixes for bugs introduced in the 2.x.x versions.
