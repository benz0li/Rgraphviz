\section{Version 1.9.x}{
  \itemize{
    \item Rgraphviz now requires Graphviz >= 2.8.
    \item Added graphvizCapabilities() that reports the capabilities of
    Graphviz.  This requires Graphviz >= 2.28 and returns NULL if the
    Rgraphviz installation does not support it.
    \item Rgraphviz now comes bundled with Graphviz 2.28, greatly
    simplifying installation.
