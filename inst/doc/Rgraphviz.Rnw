\title{HowTo Render A Graph Using Rgraphviz}
\maketitle

\section{Overview}
This article will demonstrate how to easily render a graph from R into
a postscript document using the \verb+Rgraphviz+ package.  To do this,
first we need to generate a R graph using the \verb+graph+ package:

<<createGraph>>=
library(Rgraphviz)
set.seed(123)
V <- letters[1:10]
M <- 1:4
g1 <- randomGraph(V, M, .2)
g1
@

\section{A look at graph2ps}

At this point, the graph can be written out to a postscript file using
the \em{graph2ps} function.  \em{graph2ps} has the following
set of arguments:

\begin{verbatim}
graph2ps(graph,name,kind=0,fileName="graph.ps")

graph:    A graph object.
name:     The name of the graph.
kind:     The type of graph (see below)
filename: The name of the file to output to.
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt kind} parameter is an integer value with the following
meanings:
	0: An undirected graph
	1: A directed graph
	2: A strict undirected graph
	3: A strict directed graph.
Note that strict graphs do not allow self arcs or multi-edges.

\section{Rending your graph}

Once you have decided what style (directed/undirected/etc) you wish
your graph to be rendered as, you can now create the postscript file.
Note that here we are using a temporary file to output to.
 
<<render>>=
outFile <- tempfile()
graph2ps(g1,"A Random Graph",kind=0,file=outFile)
@

From here, the output file that you choose can be displayed or printed
using your preferred methods.
